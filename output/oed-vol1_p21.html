It is hoped that reasonable accuracy has been attained in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 169 469 2214 512">dates and references: in the former, absolute accuracy is in many cases impossible, and, for the purposes of this work,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 170 519 1801 560">not essential; in the latter, errors are inevitable in the work of so many years and so many readers.</span> </p>

      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 1024 1202 1357 1233">COMBINATIONS.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 245 1263 2216 1303">Under this term are included all collocations of simple words in which the separate spelling of each word is retained,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 165 1313 2216 1353">whether they are formally connected by the hyphen, or virtually by the unity of their signification. The formal union</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 1361 2217 1402">and the actual by no means coincide; not only is the use of the hyphen a matter of indifference in an immense number</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 1411 2215 1452">of cases, but in many where it is habitually used, the combination implies no unity of signification ; while others, in which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 166 1459 2213 1502">there is a distinct unity or specialization of meaning, are not hyphened. The primary use of the hyphen is <em>grammatical:</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 1510 2215 1551">it implies either that the syntactic relation between two words is closer than if they stood side by side without it, or that</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 1560 2216 1601">the relation is a <em>less usual </em>one than that which would at first sight suggest itself to us, if we saw the two words standing</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 163 1611 2215 1651">unconnected. Thus, in the three sentences, ' <em>After consideration </em>had been given to the proposal, it was duly accepted,'</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 166 1659 2215 1700">'<em>After consideration </em>the proposal was accepted,' <em>'After-consideration </em>had shown him his mistake,' we have <em>first </em>no im-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 1709 2215 1750">mediate syntactic relation between <em>after </em>(conjunctive adverb) and <em>consideration; second/)', </em>the relation of preposition and</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 1759 2215 1798">object; <em>thirdly, </em>the relation of attribute and substantive, closer than the first, less usual than the second (since <em>after </em>is more</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 165 1808 2217 1848">commonly a preposition than an adjective). But <em>after-consideration </em>is not really a single word, any more than <em>subsequent</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 1858 2216 1897"><em>consideration, fuller consideration </em>; the hyphen being merely a convenient help to the sense, which would be clearly ex-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 163 1906 2215 1946">pressed in speech by the different phrase-accentuation of <em>a-fter considera-tion </em>and <em>a-fter consider a'(ton. </em>And as this ' help</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 1955 2214 1995">to the sense' is not always equally necessary, nor its need equally appreciated in the same place, it is impossible that</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 2004 2214 2044">its use should be uniform. Nevertheless <em>after-consideration, </em>as used above, is on the way to become a single word, which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 2054 2214 2094"><em>reconsideration </em>(chiefly because <em>re- </em>is not a separate word, but also because we have <em>reconsider) </em>is reckoned to be;</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 163 2104 2212 2143">and indeed <em>close grammatical relation </em>constantly accompanies close union of sense, so that in many combinations the hyphen</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 163 2153 2213 2192">becomes an expression of this unification of sense. When this unification and specialization has proceeded so far that we</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 162 2202 2211 2242">no longer analyze the combination into its elements, but take it in as a whole, as in <em>blackberry, postman, newspaper, </em>pro-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 164 2252 2212 2291">nouncing it in speech with a single accent, the hyphen is usually omitted, and the fully developed compound is written as</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 163 2301 2212 2340">a single word. But as this also is a question of degree, there are necessarily many compounds as to which usage has not</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 163 2350 2211 2389">yet determined whether they are to be written with the hyphen or as single words. Many specialized combinations,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 163 2400 2212 2438">indeed, are often not even hyphened: especially is this the case with <em>descriptive names, </em>formed of a substantive preceded</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 162 2449 2208 2489">by an adjective or possessive case, or followed by a phrase, as <em>Aaron's Rod, All fours, Blue John, Jack by the hedge,</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 155 2497 1004 2538"><em>Jack in a box, Jew's harp, Sea Anemone, Sea Horse.</em></span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 245 2556 2210 2594">There is thus considerable difficulty in determining to what extent combinations are matters for the lexicographer,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 162 2605 2210 2644">and to what extent they are merely grammatical. While no attempt is made fully to solve this difficulty, combinations</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 162 2654 2209 2693">formal and virtual are, for practical purposes, divided into three classes: <em>First, </em>those in which each word retains its full</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 163 2703 2210 2742">meaning, the relation between them falling under one or other of the ordinary grammatical categories. Of these, specimens</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 162 2752 2209 2793">merely are given, at the end of each Article, which are printed in <em>italics, </em>and illustrated collectively by a few quotations.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 162 2802 2208 2841"><em>Second: </em>Combinations of which the signification is somewhat specialized, but still capable of being briefly explained in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 162 2851 2209 2890">a few words, in connexion with their cognates. These also are concisely treated at the end of the Main Article, where</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 162 2901 2207 2940">they are printed in small Clarendon type in an alphabetical series, and illustrated by quotations arranged in the same order.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 163 2949 2208 2990">When these are very numerous the word illustrated is distinguished in the quotation by prefixing *, in order that it may</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 162 2999 2206 3038">catch the eye more readily. <em>Third: </em>Combinations which attain in specialization of sense to the position of full compounds</span> </p>
