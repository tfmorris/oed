      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 646 339 2529 378">IV. The Quotations illustrate the forms and uses of the word, showing the age of the word generally, and of its</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 388 2528 428">various senses particularly; the earliest and, in obsolete words or senses, the latest, known instances of its occurrence</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 437 2528 477">being always quoted. Except in special cases, where the letters of the Greek alphabet, <em>a, </em>ft <em>y, </em>&amp;c. are used to separate</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 481 486 2528 526">parallel forms, the illustration of the <em>forms </em>is subordinated to that of the <em>senses: </em>the quotations illustrating each sense</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 536 2528 575">immediately follow the explanation. They are arranged chronologically, so as to give about one for each century,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 585 2529 625">though various considerations often render a larger number necessary. The original spelling is retained, as an essential</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 480 634 2528 674">part of the history of the language. But merely graphical or typographical devices, such as contractions, erratic</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 480 682 2529 723">presence of capitals, and (in seventeenth-century books) employment of italics to emphasize words, phrases, or whole</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 480 732 2529 772">passages, are not reproduced; and simple blunders, which would mislead the reader, are tacitly corrected. The recent</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 781 2290 821">use of italics, to indicate a doubt about the status of a word, is retained as being often of historical importance.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 547 842 2530 876">As to letters, the Old and Middle English ' thorn' (}&gt; = M) and Old English 'divided <em>d' </em>or 'the' (8; usually only a variant of ' ]&gt;', though some-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 882 2529 915">times distinguished, as in the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">KEY </span>TO <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">PRONUNCIATION) </span>are retained; also ME. ' open-tailed <em>g', </em>or ' yea' (3=/ initially, <em>gh </em>finally). In Old</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 483 920 2528 955">English, the letter <em>g </em>had the form ' J, <em>g</em>' (a peculiar British development of the Roman G). Besides the original sound in <em>go, gild, </em>this letter had also</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 481 960 2530 994">(at least in later Old English) a fricative sound as in German ta^f, or Irish louy// (or both', and a palatalized sound, approximately <em>&#8212;y mye,yes. </em>After</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 999 2529 1033">the Norman Conquest the modern forms ' g, <em>g', </em>were introduced (from French) for the sound in <em>go, </em>and the new sound in .finder ; but the OE. form</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 480 1039 2530 1073">(in process of time slightly modified) was retained for the sounds in <em>\ougA, yes, </em>till the introduction of Printing. In printing Old English,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 1077 2529 1112">modern scholars sometimes reproduce the contemporary <em>'s,g' </em>(as is done by Sievers, in his <b>Angelsaehsischt GrammatiK), </b>but more commonly</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 1117 2528 1151">substitute modern ' g, <em>g'. </em>The adoption of cither course exclusively in this work would have broken the historical continuity of the forms ; in the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 480 1157 2527 1190">one case, we should have had the same word appealing in the eleventh century as ' sold ', and in the twelfth century as 'gold '; in the other, the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 1196 2529 1229">same word written in the eleventh century ' ge ' and in twelfth century ' 3e '. To avoid this, both forms are here used in Old English, in accordance</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 1235 2529 1269">with the Middle English distinction in their use ; thus, ' gold ', ' so ', ' decs '&#8226; The reader will understand that ' g' and ' s ' represent the same Old</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 481 1275 2528 1309">English letter, and that the distinction made between them is purely editorial <b>(though </b>certainly corresponding to a distinction of sound in OE.).</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 481 1315 2529 1352">For ME. the form ' 3' commonly used in reprints is employed, so that OE. ' sc ' becomes ME. ' se ', modern ' ye' ; OE. ' senos, senoh <em>'</em><em>t</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 480 1356 997 1387">ME. ' yno;, inouj', mod. ' enough '.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 562 1409 2531 1449">It is to be distinctly borne in mind that the quotations are not merely examples of the fully developed use of the word</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 480 1459 2531 1499">or special sense under which they are cited: they have also to illustrate its origin, its gradual separation from allied words</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 480 1508 2531 1548">or senses, or even, by negative evidence, its non-existence at the given date. It would often have been desirable to annotate</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 480 1558 2532 1598">the quotations, explaining the purpose for which they are adduced; but the exigencies of space render this impossible, and</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 1607 2533 1649">they are therefore left to speak for themselves. Some help has been offered by enclosing within [. . .] quotations given for</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 1659 1137 1698">what may be called subsidiary purposes.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 562 1706 2531 1747">The need to keep the Dictionary within practicable limits has also rendered it necessary to give only a minimum</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 1756 2533 1797">of quotations selected from the material available, and to make those given as brief as possible. It is to be observed</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 479 1804 2533 1846">that in their abridged form they simply illustrate the word, phrase, or construction, for which they are given, and do</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 481 1854 2533 1896">not necessarily express the sentiments of their authors, though in no case have they been intentionally curtailed in such</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 481 1904 2533 1946">a way as to misrepresent their original meaning. This, however, may always be ascertained, and the full context recovered,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 1954 2533 1995">by help of the <em>exact reference </em>to author, work, and passage, which it is a special feature of this work to give. Here</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 481 2004 2534 2043">also the utmost conciseness has been indispensable; the exact date renders the surnames only of authors in most cases</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 2052 2534 2091">sufficient; the titles of books are so abbreviated as to be recognizable by those who know them, or to be adequate for the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 2102 2534 2142">purpose of reference to a library or bibliographical catalogue. This is all that is now attempted; but a list, hereafter to be</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 481 2151 2535 2191">given, of all the authors and works quoted, with the editions read, and the Readers who extracted them for the Dictionary</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 483 2201 2534 2239">will give the full title of each work and form of abbreviation used, as well as indicate the mode of reference to each. Mean-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 481 2250 2534 2289">while, it may be stated that, in order to make the latter as simple as possible, an approximately uniform value has been given</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 2299 2535 2339">to different forms of numerals. Thus, in all works, Roman Capitals (IV.) stand for <em>rolume; </em>small capitals (iv.) for</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 2347 2536 2388"><em>book, par/, </em>or other larger division; lower-case letters (iv.) for <em>chapter </em>or its equivalent; and Arabic numerals (42) for</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 477 2398 2536 2437"><em>page. </em>Other divisions, as <em>marginal section</em>&#8212;the most useful of references, since it is not dependent on the paging of a</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 2447 2536 2487">particular edition&#8212;are indicated by special marks. In the Essayists of the i8th c. <em>(Spectator, </em>&amp;c.), of which the editions</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 482 2497 2534 2535">are innumerable, the reference T is to the paragraphs of each essay or number, counted for this purpose. In <em>Poetry,</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 483 2545 2534 2586">the reference iv. iv. 42 means <em>act, scene, line; </em>or <em>canto, stanza, line, </em>(rarely <em>book, canto, stanza?) </em>as the work may be divided.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 484 2594 2534 2635">In <em>Shaksfiere </em>(where the reading is that of the First Folio, 1623) the lines of the Globe edition are referred to. In</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 486 2644 2535 2682">dramatic works, or other long poems, of which the lines are not numbered, the Arabic numerals mean the <em>page </em>of the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 485 2692 2536 2733">edition quoted. Single poems are, whenever possible, cited by <em>name </em>and <em>line; </em>in Chaucer's <em>Canterbury Tales, </em>every</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 485 2741 2538 2783">edition of which has its own order and numbering, the only useful mode of reference was to number the lines of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 485 2789 2535 2831">each piece, tale, or prologue, separately. As neither MSS. nor editions agree as to the junction of the <em>Canon's Yeoman's</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 486 2838 2535 2879"><em>Prologue </em>and <em>Tale, </em>the two have been reckoned as one piece. <em>Melibaus </em>and the <em>Parson's Tale </em>are referred to by the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 486 2888 2534 2929">versicles as divided in the Six-text edition, but numbered separately. In many works, both prose and verse, the only</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 487 2935 2446 2978">available reference has been to the <em>volume </em>and <em>page </em>of a <em>specified edition, </em>which is thus indicated, ' Wks. 1802, III. 178 '.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 569 2984 2535 3026">Wherever practicable, a work is dated and quoted from its first edition: if the reference is to a later edition (as</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 488 3034 2534 3075">has been often unavoidable), the date of this is added (within parentheses) to the reference *.
