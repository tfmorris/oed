      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 248 1818 286">xviii NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 535 341 2500 386">The Language presents yet another undefined frontier, when it is viewed in relation to <em>time. </em>The living vocabulary</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 389 2500 435">is no more permanent in its constitution than definite in its extent. It is not to-day what it was a century ago, still less</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 439 2495 484">what it will be a century hence. Its constituent elements are in a state of slow but incessant dissolution and renovation.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 487 2501 533">' Old words' are ever becoming obsolete and dying out: ' new words' are continually pressing in. And the death of a</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 537 2501 579">word is not an event of which the date can be readily determined. It is a vanishing process, extending over a lengthened</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 586 2502 632">period, of which contemporaries never see the end. Our own words never become obsolete : it is always the words of our</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 635 2505 681">grandfathers that have died with them. Even after we cease to use a word, the memory of it survives, and the word itself</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 684 2499 730">survives as a possibility; it is only when no one is left to whom its use is still possible, that the word is wholly dead.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 734 2501 779">Hence, there are many words of which it is doubtful whether they are still to be considered as part of the living language ;</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 783 2502 828">they are alive to some speakers, and dead to others. And, on the other hand, there are many claimants to admission into</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 832 2502 877">the recognized vocabulary (where some of them will certainly one day be received), that are already current coin with</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 881 2079 926">some speakers and writers, and not yet 'good English', or even not English at all, to others.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 535 930 2501 974">If we treat the division of words into current and obsolete as a subordinate one, and extend' our idea of the Language</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 980 2502 1023">so as to include all that has been English from the beginning, or from any particular epoch, we enter upon a department</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 1029 2503 1075">of the subject, of which, from the nature of the case, our exhibition must be imperfect. For the vocabulary of past times</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 1079 2503 1122">is known to us solely from its preservation in written records ; the extent of our knowledge of it depends entirely upon the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 1128 2503 1173">completeness of the records, and the completeness of our acquaintance with them. And the farther back we go, the more</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 1177 2069 1222">imperfect are the records, the smaller is the fragment of the actual vocabulary that we can recover.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 535 1229 2504 1272">Subject to the conditions which thus encompass every attempt to construct a complete English Dictionary, the present</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 1276 2504 1319">work aims at exhibiting the history and signification of the English words now in use, or known to have been in use since</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 1326 2503 1368">the middle of the twelfth century. This date has been adopted as the only natural halting-place, short of going back to the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 1374 2504 1419">beginning, so as to include the entire Old English or ' Anglo-Saxon' Vocabulary. To do this would have involved the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 1425 2504 1466">inclusion of an immense number of words, not merely long obsolete but also having obsolete inflexions, and thus requiring,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 1475 2505 1515">if dealt with at all, a treatment different from that adapted to the words which survived the twelfth century. For not only</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 1524 2505 1566">was the stream of English literature then reduced to the tiniest thread (the slender annals of the Old English or Anglo-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 457 1574 2505 1615">Saxon Chronicle being for nearly a century its sole representative), but the vast majority of the ancient words that were</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 1624 2505 1663">destined not to live into modern English, comprising the entire scientific, philosophical, and poetical vocabulary of Old</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 1673 2505 1715">English, had already disappeared, and the old inflexional and grammatical system had been levelled to one so essentially</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 1722 2505 1763">modern as to require no special treatment in the Dictionary. Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 458 1771 2504 1813">1150. But to words actually included this date has no application; their history is exhibited from their first appearance,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 1824 693 1862">however earl}-.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 535 1870 2504 1911">Within these chronological limits, it is the aim of the Dictionary to deal with all the common words of speech and</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 1920 2509 1960">literature, and with all words which approach these in character; the limits being extended farther in the domain of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 1969 2506 2010">science and philosophy, which naturally passes into that of literature, than in that of slang or cant, which touches the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2019 2505 2058">colloquial. In scientific and technical terminology, the aim has been to include <em>all words English in form, </em>except those</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2068 2505 2107">of which an explanation would be unintelligible to any but the specialist; and such words, not English in form, as either are</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2115 2504 2157">in general use, like <em>Hippopotamus, Geranium, Aluminium, Focus, Stratum, Bronchitis, </em>or belong to the more familiar language</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2167 1286 2207">of science, as <em>Mammalia, Lepidoptera, Invertebrata.</em></span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 535 2215 2506 2256">Down to the Fifteenth Century the language existed only in dialects, all of which had a literary standing: during this</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2264 2504 2304">period, therefore, words and forms of all dialects are admitted on an equal footing into the Dictionary. Dialectal words and</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2313 2504 2353">forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of a word or sense once in general</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2363 2500 2404">use, illustrate the history of a literary word, or have themselves a certain literary currency, as is the case with many modern</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 2412 2501 2452">Scottish words. It is true that the dialectal words are mostly genuine English, and that they are an essential part of the contents</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2461 2501 2501"><em>of a. Lexicon totius Anglicilatis; </em>but the work of collecting them has not yet been completed; and, even when they shall have</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2510 2501 2551">been collected, the phonetic variety in which they exist in different localities, and the want of any fixed written forms</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2558 2501 2600">round which to group the variations, will require a method of treatment different from that applicable to the words of the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2607 2171 2650">literary language, which have an accepted uniform spelling and an approximately uniform pronunciation.</span> </p>

      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 536 2815 2500 2858">For the purposes of treatment in this Dictionary, words and phrases are classed as: (i) Main Words, (2) Sub-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2864 2500 2909">ordinate Words, (3) Combinations. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MAIN WORDS </span>comprise (i) all single words, radical or derivative (e.g. <em>Ant,</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2913 2499 2957"><em>Amphitheatrically\ </em>(2) all those compound words (and phrases) which, from their meaning, history, or importance,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 2963 2499 3005">claim to be treated in separate articles (e.g. <em>Afternoon, Almighty, Almsman, Air-pump, Aitch-bone, Ale-house, Forget-</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 3010 2498 3053"><em>me-not, Adam's apple, All fours}. </em>The articles in which these are treated constitute the <em>Main Articles. </em><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SUBORDINATE</span></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 3060 2499 3101"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">WORDS </span>include variant and obsolete forms of Main Words, and such words of bad formation, doubtful existence, or alleged</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 3109 2499 3151">use, as it is deemed proper, on any ground, to record.
