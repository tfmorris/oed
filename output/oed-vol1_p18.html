The word has never</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 1479 2503 1519">died; no year, no day probably, has passed without its being uttered by many: but this constant use has so worn it</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 1527 2503 1570">down and modified its form, that we commonly look upon <em>acre </em>as a distinct word from <em>agros, </em>with which it is con-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 1577 2500 1619">nected by many intermediate forms, of which only a few have been discriminated in writing, while the finer and more</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 1627 2503 1670">intimately connecting links have never been written.

      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 531 1726 2502 1768">If not the extant formal representative of an original Teutonic word, an English word has been <em>(2) adopted </em>(a.), or</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 447 1774 2503 1816">(3) <em>adapted </em>(ad.), from some foreign language; i.e. it is a word once foreign, but now, without or with intentional change</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 1825 2503 1866">of form, used as English; or it has been <em>{informed </em>on or from (f.) native or foreign elements, or from a combination</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 1874 2503 1915">of them. <em>Adoption </em>is essentially a popular process, at work whenever the speakers of one language come into contact with</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 449 1923 2503 1964">the speakers of another, from whom they acquire foreign things, or foreign ideas, with their foreign names. It has pre-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 1973 2500 2013">vailed in English at all periods from the earliest to the latest times: <em>inch, pound, street, rose, cat, prison, algebra, antic,</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 2023 2504 2062"><em>orange, tobacco, tea, canoe,focus, meerschaum, </em>are adopted words. <em>Adaptation </em>is essentially a learned or literary process; it</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 449 2072 2503 2112">consists in adapting a foreign word to the ' analogies of the language', and so depriving it of its foreign termination.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 2121 2504 2160">Examples are Latin or Greek words reduced to their stem form, or receiving recognized English endings. Latin words</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 448 2170 2504 2209">which lived on in Gaul there underwent regular phonetic changes, whereby they at length became ' French'; in this</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 449 2219 2501 2259">living French form they were adopted in Middle English; but in more recent times numerous Latin words have been taken</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 449 2269 2502 2308">into English directly, yet modified, in their terminations, in the same way as if they had lived on in French and been</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 449 2318 2500 2357">thence adopted into English *. Such English words originate in an <em>adaptation </em>of the Latin original, not in an adoption</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 449 2367 2501 2407">of its French (or other Romance) extant representative. <em>Formation </em>consists in the combination of existing words or parts of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 450 2416 2500 2456">words with each other, or with <em>living formalives, </em>i.e. syllables which no longer exist as separate words, but yet have an</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 450 2464 2503 2505">appreciable <em>signification </em>which they impart to the new product. Formation is the chief natural process by which the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 450 2514 2503 2555">vocabulary of a language is increased: it is both popular and learned; in its popular application, it gives such words as</span> </p>

In its origin</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 453 2855 2501 2889">a mixture of various Norman and other Northern French dialects, afterwards mixed with and greatly modified by Angevin, Parisian, Poitevin, and</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2893 2501 2929">other elements, and more and more exposed to the overpowering influence of literary French, it had yet received, on this side the Channel, a distinct</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2932 2501 2969">and independent development, following, in its phonology especially, English and not continental tendencies. As the natural speech of the higher</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 454 2972 2499 3007">and educated classes, it died out in the fourteenth century; but it maintained a kind of artificial existence for a longer period, and was used (in an in-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 3011 2501 3047">creasingly debased form) for writing law-reports down to the I /th century, in which stage it still influenced the spelling of English words. Its forms</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 3050 2500 3086">survive in many of onr terminations : <em>armour, colour, glorious, gracious, envious, perilous, arrival, espousal, language, enjoy, benefit, gaoler, caitif,</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 455 3089 2499 3122">are the actual Anglo-French forms, as distinct from those of continental Old and Modern French. As a rule, it may be assumed that the original</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 3129 2498 3164">form of every Middle English word of French origin was <em>identical </em>with the Anglo-F&gt;ench form ; and that, where a gap appears between the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 3168 2499 3203">earliest known English form of a word and its Old French equivalent, that gap would be filled up by the recovery of the Anglo-French and</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 456 3207 2499 3242">earliest English form. It was not until the fifteenth century, and chiefly at the hands of Caxton, that continental French forms and spellings</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 459 3247 1020 3281">began directly to influence our language.</span> </p>
