      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 595 501 2566 544">All Compounds and Combinations of interest or importance will thus be found either in their alphabetical order, or</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 514 550 2567 592">under the word which constitutes their first element.

      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 594 814 2565 858">The pronunciation is the actual living form or forms of a word, that is, <em>the word itself, </em>of which the current spelling</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 864 2565 904">is only a symbolization &#8212; generally, indeed, only the traditionally-preserved symbolization of an earlier form, sometimes</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 914 2565 956">imperfect to begin with, still oftener corrupted in its passage to our time. This living form is the <em>latest fact </em>in the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 964 2564 1004">form-history of the word, the starting-point of all investigations into its previous history, the only fact in its form-history</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 512 1012 2564 1055">to which the lexicographer can personally witness. For all his statements as to its previous history are only reproductions</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 512 1062 2564 1103">of the evidence of former witnesses, or deductions drawn from earlier modes of symbolizing the forms of the word then</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 1112 2563 1153">current, checked and regulated by the ascertained laws and principles of phonology. To register the current pronunciation</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 512 1161 2563 1202">is therefore essential, in a dictionary which deals with the language on historical principles. It would be manifestly absurd,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 514 1210 2564 1251">for example, to trace the form-history of the first numeral from the Old Teutonic <em>am, </em>through the Old English <em>an, </em>to the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 514 1259 2564 1300">Middle English <em>oan, on, oon, one, </em>and to stop short at the last of these, without recognizing the modern English wz&gt;n, which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 512 1310 2565 1349">represents a greater change within the last three and a half centuries than had previously taken place in 1 500 years. The</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 1359 2565 1398">fact that the <em>written </em>history, as embodied in the spelling, accidentally stops short at the Middle English <em>one, </em>makes it all</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 512 1409 2565 1447">the more necessary to give the modern history and current form of the living word, since of these no hint is otherwise</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 512 1457 670 1495">conveyed.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 594 1507 2565 1546">But the living word is <em>sound </em>cognizable by the ear, and must therefore be itself symbolized in order to reach the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 512 1556 2566 1599">understanding through the eye. The most that can be done is to provide a careful and consistent means of representing</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 1606 2565 1645">it, in which the symbols should agree with the actual values of letters used either in the earlier or later stages of the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 1656 2565 1695">language. For historical purposes the earlier values of letters are the more convenient ; and accordingly, the symbols here</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 1705 2564 1744">adopted are the Roman letters, in most cases retaining the values which they had when first employed to write English ;</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 1755 2565 1794">to these are added such modifications and amplifications as are required by the phonetic changes and discriminations</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 1804 2565 1844">which distinguish a modern from an ancient language. The reference of the symbols to a permanent standard, such</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 1854 2565 1892">as the <em>Visible Speech </em>of Mr. A. Melville Bell, will be made elsewhere : in the following table they are merely illustrated by</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 1904 1082 1942">words which exemplify the sounds.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 580 1977 2564 2010">As a general principle, each simple sound is represented .by a single symbol. In choosing additional symbols, regard has been had to former</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 2016 2565 2050">usage or analog)' ; thus <em>'x' </em>was the Old English symbol for <em>a </em>in <em>at, </em>' 9 ' the Icelandic for <em>o </em>in not ; 3 (reversed e) is used for a sound most commonly</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 514 2055 2566 2088">written <em>e, </em>as in err, <em>evet </em>; &#187; {reversed <em>a) </em>for a sound expressed by <em>a </em>in Sanskrit and Oriental languages, as in <em>Chandarnagar </em>or <em>Chundernugger. </em>In</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 513 2095 2564 2129">the consonants, <em>i </em>(reversed r) is used for the vocalized retracted <em>r </em>in he?" ; ' J&gt; ' and ' S ' are taken from Old English, with their powers discriminated ;</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 512 2135 1555 2169">J (*/')&gt; 3 C2/')' an(i 9 <em>(</em><em>n</em><em>g) </em>fr&#176;m the Phonotypy of Messrs.

In modern English speech, vowels are regularly obscured in syllables that have neither primary nor subordinate stress, especially</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 516 2251 2567 2285">in those that follow the main stress ; they then approach, or fall into, the sound of the mid-mixed vowel or 3. But, in syllabic or rhetorical pro-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 514 2290 2566 2325">nunciation, or in singing, the original vowels are more or less heard ; by writing these with the mark of obscuration, we are enabled to indicate at</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 514 2329 2566 2364">once the theoretical and the actual pronunciation. The vowel in pass, command, variously identified by different speakers with <em>a </em>in man, and <em>a</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 515 2368 2566 2404">in father, is symbolized by the avowedly ambiguous a. Similarly, the doubtful length of the <em>o </em>in <em>off, soft, lost </em>(by some made <em>short </em>as in got, by</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 515 2407 2566 2443">some <em>long </em>as in Corfe, by others <em>medial}, </em>is indicated by <em>{&gt;. </em>In cases where sounds are identified by some English speakers, and distinguished by</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 516 2447 2566 2482">others, it has been thought best to mark the distinction, which may be disregarded by those to whom it is unknown ; thus, the sounds in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 516 2486 2567 2521"><em>iir </em>and <em>fur </em>are discriminated by the majority of orthoepists, though commonly identified by natives of the south of, England, to whom our</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 516 2526 1908 2561"><em>Ki </em>and fw will thus indicate the same sound. So 9 and <em>p, </em>in watch, Scotch, are identified by many.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 582 2563 2566 2600">The generally recognized <em>Diphthongs </em>in <em>by, boy, bow, few, pure, </em>are expressed by ai, oi, au, i&#187;, iii ; and the diphthong in <em>ay </em>(yes) by ai (when</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 516 2603 2567 2640">distinguished from that in <em>eye, </em>si). After <em>r, </em>the simple <em>u, </em>u, take the place of <em>iii, </em>iii ; which is also the usage of many speakers after /, as in <em>lieu,</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 518 2642 2568 2678">h&lt;nar, l&#171;re, where others make, or try to make, a diphthong.

The half-sized ', u, are also</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 518 2681 2566 2718">used to express the second element in the imperfect or doubtful diphthongs in fate, note (f&lt;Tlt, nout), which many orthoepists treat only as long <em>S, 6 ;</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 519 2720 2566 2756">the half-sized &#187; is similarly used to express the non-recognized vowel-element developed between I, e, o, u, and J or r, as in <em>pier, pare, pore, -poor,</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 519 2764 794 2797"><em>weary (pi'i, </em>wi&#187;'ri).</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 585 2798 2566 2836"><em>Syllables </em>are not divided ; but, when two vowels come together and do not make a diphthong, they are separated by the break (,)&gt; which in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 518 2837 2566 2874">this case divides two syllables. The break is not written between the two vowels in groups such as <em>-ial, -ian, </em>in <em>pitlor-ial, Fen-ian, </em>which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 518 2873 2565 2915">are pronounced either in two syllables, or (familiarly) in one.

Also in words</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 520 2954 2568 2990">like <em>antacid, ant ambulacra! </em>(jc:nt|ae'sid, Ee:nt|CcmbittltTl'kral) where the first syllable is <em>ant-, </em>not <em>an-. </em>And it is used in 'combinations and long words</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 519 2993 2568 3030">with two accents, to separate the two accentual groups into which the word naturally falls, as in <em>plano-convex, agamogenesis </em>(pU7i:no,k(vnvt-ks,</span> </p>
