      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 1014 584 1445 614"><b>THE   VOCABULARY.</b></span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 287 675 2253 725"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">THE </span>Vocabulary of a widely-diffused and highly-cultivated living language is not a fixed quantity circumscribed by</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 204 724 2251 773">definite limits. That vast aggregate of words and phrases which constitutes the Vocabulary of English-speaking men</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 203 773 2251 816">presents, to the mind that endeavours to grasp it as a definite whole, the aspect of one of those nebulous masses familiar to</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 203 823 2251 870">the astronomer, in which a clear and unmistakable nucleus shades off on all sides, through zones of decreasing brightness,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 202 872 2252 917">to a dim marginal film that seems to end nowhere, but to lose itself imperceptibly in the surrounding darkness. In its</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 202 922 2253 969">constitution it may be compared to one of those natural groups of the zoologist or botanist, wherein typical species</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 202 970 2252 1016">forming the characteristic nucleus of the order, are linked on every side to other species, in which the typical character is</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 201 1020 2250 1067">less and less distinctly apparent, till it fades away in an outer fringe of aberrant forms, which merge imperceptibly in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 201 1069 2251 1110">various surrounding orders, and whose own position is ambiguous and uncertain. For the convenience of classification,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 200 1118 2250 1162">the naturalist may draw the line, which bounds a class or order, outside or inside of a particular form; but Nature has</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 200 1166 2249 1212">drawn it nowhere. So the English Vocabulary contains a nucleus or central mass of many thousand words whose</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 203 1216 2250 1262">' Anglicity' is unquestioned; some of them only literary, some of them only colloquial, the great majority at once literary</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 201 1265 2249 1309">and colloquial,&#8212;they are the <em>Common Words </em>of the language. But they are linked on every side with other words which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 201 1315 2250 1358">are less and less entitled to this appellation, and which pertain ever more and more distinctly to the domain of local</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 201 1363 2249 1407">dialect, of the slang and cant of' sets' and classes, of the peculiar technicalities of trades and processes, of the scientific</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 201 1413 2251 1459">terminology common to all civilized nations, of the actual languages of other lands and peoples. And there is absolutely</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 201 1462 2250 1502">no defining line in any direction: the circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no discernible</span> </p>

      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 203 2326 2248 2369">circumference *. Yet practical utility has some bounds, and a Dictionary has definite limits : the lexicographer must, like</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 205 2375 2253 2418">the naturalist, ' draw the line somewhere', in each diverging direction. He must include all the ' Common Words ' of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 207 2424 2249 2465">literature and conversation, and such of the scientific, technical, slang, dialectal, and foreign words as are passing into</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 206 2475 2248 2515">common use, and approach the position or standing of ' common words', well knowing that the line which he draws will</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 205 2522 2247 2563">not satisfy all his critics. For to every man the domain of ' common words' widens out in the direction of his own</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 204 2571 2248 2613">reading, research, business, provincial or foreign residence, and contracts in the direction with which he has no practical</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 203 2620 2254 2661">connexion: no one man's English is <em>all </em>English. The lexicographer must be satisfied to exhibit the greater part of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 203 2669 1897 2710">the vocabulary of <em>each </em>one, which will be immensely more than the whole vocabulary of <em>any </em>one.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 286 2718 2250 2760">In addition to, and behind, the common vocabulary, in all its diverging lines, lies an infinite number of <em>Proper </em>or</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 205 2766 2248 2809">merely <em>denotative </em>names, outside the province of lexicography, yet touching it in thousands of points, at which these names,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 205 2815 2249 2858">and still more the adjectives and verbs formed upon them, acquire more or less of connotative value. Here also limits</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 205 2865 895 2903">more or less arbitrary must be assumed.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 270 2960 2250 2999">* The above diagram will explain itself, as an attempt to express to the eye the aspect in which the Vocabulary is here presented, and also</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 206 3001 2249 3039">some of the relations of its elements typical and aberrant. The centre is occupied by the ' common ' words, in which literary and colloquial usage</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 209 3043 2250 3080">meet. ' Scientific' and ' foreign ' words enter the common language mainly through literature ; ' slang' words ascend through colloquial use ; the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 213 3084 2249 3119">' technical' terms of crafts and processes, and the ' dialect' words, blend with the common language both in speech and literature. Slang also</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 208 3122 2248 3162">touches on one side the technical terminology of trades and occupations, as in ' nautical slang,' ' Public School slang,' ' the slang of the Stock</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 212 3164 2249 3204">Exchange,' and on another passes into true dialect. Dialects similarly pass into foreign languages. Scientific terminology passes on one side</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 211 3206 2250 3243">into purely foreign words, on another it blends with the technical vocabulary of art and manufactures. It is not possible to fix the point at</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 216 3245 1209 3284">which the ' English Language' stops, along any of these diverging lines.</span> </p>
