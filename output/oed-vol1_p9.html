      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 1139 244 2276 287">PREFACE. K     r xi</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 232 340 2278 384">sufficiently popular to have attained to some standard pronunciation, how. much more it is sc&gt;wit:h words such</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 231 384 2278 446">as <em>ace famine, </em>which have no popular currency, and which indeed were ma'&amp;^pet primarily^ t&#187;2b^ sj5okeji but</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 230 444 2277 502">to be used in books, and as to the pronunciation of which, or the question whetHet&gt;/'$iey are pronoirtSp'gialb^,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 230 499 2277 552">no thought was given by their makers? On several occasions, the Editor has app fifed directly to the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 230 563 2277 606">introducer of a word, to know how he pronounces it, or means it to be pronounced, and has rectfttd the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 228 618 2277 663">answer, that he has never thought of its pronunciation, does not presume to say how it ought to be pro-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 229 674 2280 718">nounced, and leaves it to people to pronounce as they like, or to the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">DICTIONARY </span>to say what is the <em>right</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 227 730 2277 776">pronunciation. This, of course, reverses the natural order of language, in which speech comes first, and writing</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 227 785 2277 831">is only its symbolization ; for here the first thing is the written symbol addressed to the eye (and reminding</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 842 2276 885">the reader perhaps more or less distinctly of other written symbols which are to be found in the Greek</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 226 897 2275 942">Lexicon), while, for 'pronunciation', anything passes muster which suffices to recall the written symbol in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 954 2275 997">question ; just as any reading of a mathematical formula passes muster, if it enables an auditor to write down</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 1009 2274 1054">the formula again. In dealing with words in which two or more pronunciations are current, these pronuncia-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 1067 2275 1110">tions are given in the Dictionary ; in the case of those in which no standard exists, an attempt has been</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 227 1122 2276 1166">made to follow analogies so far as they go, and at least to mark the place of the stress ; but sometimes it has</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 1178 843 1219">not been possible to do even this.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 311 1290 2476 1334">The preparation of this volume has taken a much longer time than any of the promoters of the work Difficulties of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 1337 2415 1391">anticipated.    The time has been consumed chiefly in two directions : first, with the larger articles, as those on the work'</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 1402 2273 1445"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">AT, BY, </span>BUT, BE, BEAR, BREAK, the construction of which has occupied many days, sometimes even weeks.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 1459 2274 1502">The mere study of the result, arranged in some degree of order, gives little idea of the toil and difficulties</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 1515 2273 1559">encountered in bringing into this condition what was at first a shapeless mass of many thousand quotations.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 1571 2274 1614">And in this part of the work there was practically no assistance to be got from the labours of our pre-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 1628 2278 1669">decessors ; the attempt has never been made before to exhibit such a combined logical and historical view of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 1684 2274 1727">the sense-development of English words.    Our own attempts lay no claim to perfection ; but they represent</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 1740 2273 1773">the most that could be done in the time and with the data at our command.     The other direction in which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 1796 2272 1838">much time has been consumed is the elucidation of the meaning of obscure terms, sometimes obsolete, some-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 1852 2273 1894">times current, belonging to matters of history, customs, fashions, trade, or manufactures.    In many cases, the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 1908 2270 1951">only thing known about these was contained in the quotations, often merely allusive, which had been collected</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 1964 2271 2006">by the diligence of our readers.    They were to be found in no dictionary, or, if mentioned in some, were</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 2020 2270 2062">explained in a way which our quotations evidently showed to be erroneous.    The difficulty of obtaining first-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 2076 2270 2115">hand and authoritative information about these has often been immense, and sometimes insurmountable.   Ten,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 2132 2271 2173">twenty, or thirty letters have sometimes been written to persons who, it was thought, might possibly know, or</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 2187 2268 2230">succeed in finding out, something definite on the subject ; and often weeks have passed, and 'copy ' advanced</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 226 2243 2267 2286">into the state of 'proof ', 'proof into 'revise', and ' revise' even into 'final', before any results could be obtained.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 227 2299 2267 2341">It is incredible what labour has had to be expended, sometimes, to find oat the facts for an article which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 2355 2268 2396">occupies not more than five or six lines ; or even to be able to write the words " Derivation unknown ", as</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 2410 2265 2452">the net outcome of hours of research and of testing the statements put forth without hesitation in other works.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 2466 2468 2509">These experiences have often called to mind the classical words in which Dr. Johnson recounts in his Preface Dr. Johnson's</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 224 2522 2266 2566">his similar difficulties :  " When first I engaged in this work, I resr/ived to leave neither words nor things</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 226 2577 2264 2622">unexamined, and pleased myself with a prospect of the hours which I should revel away in feasts of literature,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 2633 2264 2677">with the obscure recesses of northern learning which I should e*ter and ransack ; the treasures with which I</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 2689 2263 2733">expected every search into those neglected mines to reward my labour, and the triumph with which I should</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 225 2745 2264 2788">display my acquisitions to mankind.    When I had thus enquired into the original of words, I resolved to show</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 226 2801 2266 2845">likewise my attention to things ; to pierce deep into every science, to enquire the nature of every substance of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 227 2855 2266 2901">which I inserted the name, to limit every idea by a definition strictly logical, and exhibit every production of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 226 2911 2264 2956">art or nature in an accurate description, that my book might be in place of all other dictionaries whether</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 227 2967 2260 3012">appellative or technical.     But these were the drean* of a poet doomed at last to wake a lexicographer.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 232 3023 2259 3062">I soon found that it is too late to look for instruments, when the work calls for execution, and that whatever</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 227 3079 2257 3124">abilities I had brought to my task, with those I trust finally perform it.     To deliberate whenever I doubted,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 229 3133 2258 3180">to enquire whenever I was ignorant, would have protracted the undertaking without end, and, perhaps, without</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 231 3189 2257 3236">much improvement ; for I did not find by my *irst experiments, that what I had not of my own was easily to</span> </p>
