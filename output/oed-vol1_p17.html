      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 283 428 2247 473">Every Main Word is treated, once for all, under its modern current or most usual spelling; or, if obsolete, under the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 200 478 2069 518">most typical of its latest spellings; the form or spelling thus chosen being considered the <em>Main Form </em>of the word.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 265 538 2248 578">Occasionally a form or spelling of an obsolete word has been assumed, which is not actually found in the quotations adduced, but is in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 199 578 2251 619">accordance with the usual analogies of the language, as seen in kindred words. Thus <em>Aiinoyotisly </em>is given as the Main Form, on the analogy of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 199 617 1133 650"><em>annoy, annoyous, </em>although only <em>anoyously </em>has actually been found.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 279 676 2250 719">All other important forms of each word, current or obsolete, are entered in their alphabetical order, as <em>Subordinate</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 205 725 1644 766"><em>Words, </em>and are there concisely referred to the <em>Main Form </em>under which they are treated.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 280 774 2248 819">When a word which is historically one has different grammatical relations, it is treated as one word only, and the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 198 824 2248 870">different relations are indicated by the division of the article into sections (marked A, B, C). This refers especially to</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 198 873 2249 919">substantives used also <em>attributively </em>(or <em>objectively), </em>as in ' an ounce of <em>gold, </em>a <em>gold </em>watch, ^/(/-coloured scales '; to adjectives</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 923 2248 963">used <em>substaniively </em>or <em>pronominaUy, </em>as in ' the <em>catholic </em>church, a good <em>catholic; that </em>book, <em>that </em>is mine, the words <em>thai </em>he</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 971 2249 1016">spoke'; to adjectives used adverbially, as in ' the <em>according </em>voice of national wisdom', ' he acted <em>according </em>to orders ';</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 1021 2253 1066">to adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions, originally the same word, as <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ABOUT, AFTER, SINCE, </span>As ; and of course <em>a fortiori</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 1071 2247 1112">to verbs used <em>transitively </em>and <em>intransitively, </em>as ' to abide battle, to abide at home,' which, in some dictionaries, are reckoned</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 198 1120 547 1150">as two distinct words.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 266 1175 2251 1210">In this <b>Dictionary,'transitive </b>and <em>intransitive </em>seldom appear even as leading divisions of a verb, but, in accordance with the actual history of</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 199 1215 2249 1253">the word, in most cases only as varying and often temporary constructions, subordinate lo the different senses, and liable to pass one into the other</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 200 1254 2248 1292">in the development of the language. Thus a verb at one time intransitive finally takes a simple object, through the phonetic decay of a dative or</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 1294 2248 1332">genitive ending, or the elision of a preposition, and is accounted transitive, without any change either in form or meaning (e.g. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ANSWER) </span>; and a</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 199 1332 2246 1373">verb used transitively, likewise without change of meaning and form at length becomes intransitive, through the regular modern English suppression</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 199 1373 2248 1411">of the reflexive pronoun (e.g. Kzek. xx. 22 I <em>withdrew </em>mine hand ; Mark iii. 7 Jesus <em>withdrew </em>himself to the sea; <em>Revised Version, </em>Jesus <em>with-</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 198 1412 2248 1454"><em>drew </em>to the sea).

      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 281 2122 2247 2169">1. The <em>Main Form, </em>i.e. the usual or typical spelling, as already described.    (In certain cases where two spellings are</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 2173 2247 2218">in current use, both are given in the Main Form, as <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ANALYSE -YZE, CHEMISTRY CHYMISTRY, INFLECTION INFLEXION.)    </span>Words</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 2222 1948 2264">believed to be <em>obsolete </em>are distinguished by prefixing t; <em>non-naturalized or partially-naturalized </em>words, by ||.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 264 2278 2246 2316">In the case of rare words, especially those adopted or formed from Latin equivalents, it is often difficult to say whether they are or are not</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 196 2317 2247 2356">obsolete. They are permanent possibilities, rarely needed, but capable of being used whenever they are needed, rather than actually discarded</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 196 2357 1510 2391">terms. To these and other words, of which the obsoleteness is doubtful, the f is not prefixed.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 264 2396 2247 2429">As to their citizenship in the language, words may be classed as <em>Naturals, Denhens, Aliens,</em>and <em>Casuals. </em><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">NATURALS </span>include all <em>native </em>words</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 199 2435 2247 2470"><em>like/at/ier, </em>and all fully <em>naturalised </em>words like <em>street, rose, knapsack, gas, parasol. </em><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">DENIZENS </span>are words fully naturalized as to use, but not as to</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 190 2473 2247 2513"><em>form, injlcxion, or pronunciation, </em>as <em>aide-de-camp, locus, carte-de-visile, table d'hote. </em><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ALIENS </span>are names of foreign objects, titles, etc., which we require</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 196 2514 2247 2551">often to use, and for which we have no native equivalents, as <em>shah, geyser, cicerone, targum, baekshcesh, sepoy. </em><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">CASUALS </span>are foreign words of the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 2553 2246 2590">same class, not in habitual use, which for special and temporary purposes occur in books of foreign travel, letters of foreign correspondents, and the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 196 2592 2246 2627">like. There are no fixed limits between these classes, and the constant tendency is for words to pass upwards from the last to the first. But, while</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 2632 2247 2669">casuals and aliens from barbarous languages are readily and quickly naturalized, words from French and the learned languages, especially Latin,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 196 2671 2246 2709">which are assumed to be known to all the polite, are often kept in the position of denizens for centuries : we still treat <em>phenomenon </em>as Greek, <em>genus</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 2711 2246 2748">as Latin, <em>aide-de-camp </em>as French. The words marked with || in the Dictionary comprise <em>Denizens </em>and <em>Aliens, </em>and such <em>Casuals </em>as approach, or</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 2749 2245 2785">formerly approached, the position of these. Opinions will differ as to the claims of some that are included and some that are excluded, and also</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 2788 2245 2825">as to the line dividing <em>Denizens </em>from <em>Naturals, </em>and the position assigned to some words on either side of it. If we are to distinguish these</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 197 2827 854 2857">classes at all, a line must be drawn somewhere.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 280 2876 2243 2920">2.
