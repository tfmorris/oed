      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 196 366 2242 407"><em>black-bird, shep-herd, work-er, high-ness, grand-ly, a-swim, be-moan, after-noon ; </em>in learned application, such as <em>con-caten-alion,</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 196 415 2125 454"><em>mono-petal-ous, chloro-phyl, tele-phone; </em>in a mixture of the two, such as <em>acknowledge-men I, lion-ize, starv-ation, betroth-al.</em></span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 278 465 2241 504">Much of the terminology of modern science is identical, or as nearly so as the forms of the languages permit, in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 196 514 2242 553">English and French, in English, French, and German, or sometimes even in most of the European languages. It would</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 195 563 2242 602">often be as difficult as useless to ascertain in which language a particular scientific term first appeared in print, this</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 195 612 2242 650">being, linguistically, a mere accident: the word was accepted as common property from the beginning. In such cases,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 195 661 2242 701"><em>modern formation </em>(mod. f.) is employed to intimate that it is uncertain in what modern language, English or continental, the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 195 710 2226 749">word was first used; it may indeed have occurred first in some modern Latin work, either of English or foreign authorship.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 275 758 2238 799"><em>Phonetic descent </em>(:&#8212;), <em>adoption </em>(a.), <em>adaptation </em>(ad.), <em>\\orA~formation </em>(f.) are usually combined.under the term <em>derivation;</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 195 808 2132 848">but, until we know in which of them, singly or in combination, a word has originated, we do not know its Etymology.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 276 857 2242 896">In this Dictionary, words originally native are traced to their earliest known English, and, when possible, to their</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 194 906 2243 945">earliest Teutonic form, authenticated and illustrated by the cognate words in other Teutonic languages and dialects; those</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 194 955 2242 995">of foreign origin are referred to the foreign word or elements whence they were immediately adopted or formed. In certain</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 194 1004 2243 1045">cases these foreign words, especially the French, are themselves traced to their antecedent forms or component elements;</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1053 2242 1094">but these antecedents are considered only with a view to the clearer comprehension of the history and use of the word in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 194 1102 2244 1144">English. To trace the remoter history of these words, and determine their Aryan or other ' roots,' is no part of their</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 194 1151 455 1189">English history.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 276 1200 2243 1241">Of many words it has to be stated that their origin is either doubtful or altogether unknown. In such cases the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1249 2243 1293">historical facts are given, as far as they go, and their bearing occasionally indicated. But <em>conjectural etymologies </em>are rarely</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1298 2243 1340">referred to, except to point out their agreement or disagreement with the historical facts; for these, and the full discussion</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1348 1416 1389">which they require, the reader is referred to special treatises on etymology.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 357 1415 2245 1457">III. The Signification <em>(Sematology). </em>Some words have only one invariable signification; but most words that</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1464 2243 1504">have been used for any length of time in a language have acquired a long and sometimes intricate series of significations, as the</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1514 2243 1554">primitive sense has been gradually extended to include allied or associated ideas, or transferred boldly to figurative and ana-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1564 2243 1606">logical uses. This happens to a greater extent with <em>relational </em>words, as prepositions (cf. <em>About, After, Against, And, Anenl]</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 1613 2243 1653">than with <em>notional </em>words, as verbs and nouns; of these, also, it affects verbs and adjectives more than substantives ; of substan-</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 1663 2244 1703">tives, it influences those which express actions, qualities, and mental conceptions (cf. <em>Account), </em>more than those which name,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 1712 2247 1751">and are, as it were, fixed to material objects. Yet even these latter have often acquired many different senses. Thus, <em>Board</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1761 2242 1801">names a material object; yet compare: a thin <em>board, </em>a frugal <em>board, </em>a <em>card-board, board </em>and lodgings, passengers on <em>board,</em></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 1810 2244 1851">to fall over <em>board, </em>to sit at the council <em>board, </em>a <em>board </em>school, the <em>Board </em>of Trade, to tread the <em>boards, </em>a <em>sea.-Aoard </em>parish.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 1860 2243 1899">The order in which these senses were developed is one of the most important facts in the history of the word; to discover</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1910 2242 1948">and exhibit it are among the most difficult duties of a dictionary which aims at giving this history. If the historical record</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 1959 2242 1997">were complete, that is, if we possessed written examples of all the uses of each word from the beginning, the simple exhibition</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 2008 2243 2046">of these would display a rational or logical development. The historical record is not complete enough to do this, but it is</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 2057 2240 2096">usually sufficient to enable us to infer the actual order. In exhibiting this in the Dictionary, that sense is placed first which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 2106 2239 2145">was actually the earliest in the language: the others follow in the order in which they appear to have arisen. As, however,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 2154 2242 2194">the development often proceeded in <em>many </em>branching lines, sometimes parallel, often divergent, it is evident that it cannot be</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 2204 2241 2244">adequately represented in a single linear series. Hence, while the senses are numbered straight on i, 2, 3, &amp;c., they are also</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 2253 2239 2292">grouped under branches marked I, II, III, &amp;c., in each of which the historical order begins afresh. Subdivisions of the senses,</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 2301 2238 2342">varieties of construction, &amp;c., are marked a, b, c, &amp;c.; subdivisions of these, which rarely occur, (&lt;?.), <em>(b.), (c.), </em>&amp;c. So far</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 2352 2238 2390">for words of which the senses have been developed in English itself. But in adopted or adapted words which had already</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 190 2400 2237 2440">acquired various significations in the language (e.g. Latin) from which they were taken, it often happens that the order in</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 189 2449 2237 2488">which the senses appeared in English does not agree with the natural order in which they were developed in the original</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 189 2499 2238 2538">language. The English order is in fact accidental. For it was not in the primary sense that the word was first taken into</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 189 2548 2237 2586">English, but in a figurative, transferred, or specialized use, as an ecclesiastical, legal, grammatical, or medical term, which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 190 2597 2237 2636">perhaps took root in our language, and here received a development of its own. Subsequently, however, familiarity with</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 189 2646 2236 2685">the Latin language and literature sometimes led to a fresh adoption of the word in the primary sense, or to a sudden</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 189 2695 2236 2734">extension of English usage, so as to include the primary sense, which thus appears as of quite late origin in English.</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 190 2744 2235 2783">In such a case it is not possible to make the historical order of the senses in English agree with the logical order in which</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 190 2793 2237 2832">they arose in Latin or other previous language; and every such word must be treated in the way which seems best</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 190 2842 2236 2882">suited to exhibit the facts of its own history and use. Instances of such words are afforded by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ADVKNT, AGONY, AN-</span></span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 191 2891 530 2925"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">NUNCIATION, APPEND.</span></span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 275 2939 2232 2980"><em>Obsolete Senses, </em>like obsolete words, have t prefixed, so as to be at once distinguished from those now in use. Under ^f</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 191 2988 1336 3025">are included <em>Catachrestic </em>and erroneous uses, confusions, and the like.</span> </p>
      <p class="ocr_par"><span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 273 3037 2234 3078">To a great extent the <em>explanations </em>of the meanings have been framed anew upon a study of all the quotations</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 3086 2234 3126">for each word collected for this work, of which those printed form only a small part. But the labours of other</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 3135 2228 3175">scholars in this, the most successfully cultivated department of English lexicography, have not been neglected. In</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 3184 2228 3224">particular, the explanations of Dr. Johnson and of his editor Archdeacon Todd have often been adopted unchanged</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 193 3229 2229 3273">(within inverted commas and marked J. or T.), as have those of N. Bailey, and other early lexicographers, to whom it</span> <span class="ocr_line" title="bbox 192 3280 2068 3321">is only right to give credit for original work which has become the common property of all their successors.</span> </p>
